# Mersenne Twister: Correlation of Sub-sequences

## Motivation

Is the Mersenne Twister Random Number Generator a good RNG for
multi-threaded application?

The goal of this project is to determinate how one can use Mersenne
Twister in order to generate non-correlated sequences of random numbers.

## How do we determinate this?

We test sub-sequences generated by Mersenne Twister with the TestU01 inter-streams correlation tests of C. Ismay.

## Description of the repository

This repository contains:
- a libmt folder: it contains the Mersenne Twister RNG as a library
- a tests folder: it contains unit tests that validate the implementation of Mersenne Twister
- files that use the TestU01 library to test sequence of Mersenne Twister

### How to compile

This project uses CMake to offer the largest possible compatibility.
1. To install CMake have a look at this page
[https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/)
2. Then run `cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"` to use linux make or
`cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles"` to use MinGW make or for the IDE you want
see other generator
3. Compile the project either with the tool you are used to or by running
`cmake --build .`
4. Finally you can run the binary

### How to run the unit tests

After having compiled the project, go to the "tests" folder and run
the command `ctest`.

### How to run the TestU01 tests

Run the program `./prog` (linux) or `prog.exe` (windows).

### "What if I don't want to install cmake and compile this myself"

"No problem", for an easier reproducibility, you can use docker.
However, if you don't know anything about docker or virtualisation, you
may want to compile the project yourself rather than using docker.

To compile and run the code with docker:
- Compile the code by building the image: `docker build -t mt-project .`
- Run the TestU01 tests by running a container: `docker run --rm mt-project`

:warning: It is mandatory to have an internet connection the first time you
build the container because it needs to download the base image namely
the one containing gcc and cmake.
